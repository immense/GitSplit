# Design: `Split-ByPath` — extract a set of paths across a branch range into a separate PR

Status: **Implemented** in this PR (`feature/split-bypath`). Target module: `GitSplit.psm1`. See `Split-ByPath` / `New-SplitByPathPlan`.

## 1. Problem

Every existing GitSplit verb takes a **single commit** (`-Ref <sha>`):

| Verb | Operates on | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Split-Commit` | one commit | carves it by hunk / line / whole-file |
| `Select-GitSplitPaths` | one commit | selects changed paths by regex |
| `Move-Commit` | one commit | cherry-picks it to another branch |
| `Remove-Commit` | one commit | drops it from a branch (rebase) |

There is **no range awareness** — no `BaseRef..HEAD`. The common real-world
scenario these verbs cannot express: *one file's changes are interleaved across
many commits in a branch, and you want them as a single separate PR.* This came
up concretely when splitting `.github/workflows/pr-e2e-playwright.yml` out of a
21-commit driver branch (immybot PR #9431 → #9441). The resolution was done by
hand with `git reset --soft <base>` + `git restore --staged <paths>`; this design
captures that as a first-class verb.

**Scope (per maintainer):** GitSplit handles *tedious mechanical git operations*.
**Out of scope:** build/test guards. `Split-ByPath` does not compile or test the
result; it performs git operations and leaves buildability to the caller. This is
deliberate — GitSplit is a git tool, not a CI gate.

## 2. Synopsis

```powershell
Split-ByPath
  -Path <string[]>                      # paths to extract (repo-relative; matched at current HEAD names)
  -DestinationBranch <string>           # mandatory
  [-BaseRef <string>]                   # default: merge-base(HEAD, origin/HEAD)
  [-DestinationBase <string>]           # default: see §4 (stacked vs flat)
  [-Squash]                             # default ON: squash source via soft-reset (see §5)
  [-RemoveFromSource]                   # default ON — a split removes the paths from source
  [-SourceMessage <string>]             # squash mode: the one source commit message
  [-DestinationMessage <string>]        # the one destination commit message
  [-Push]                               # push dest (and source if rewritten)
  [-ForcePushSource]                    # force-push rewritten source (--force-with-lease)
  [-AutoStash]                          # stash uncommitted changes, restore after
  [-KeepEmpty]                          # preserve mode: don't prune now-empty commits
  [-OutputScriptPath <string>]          # render reviewable script, don't execute
  [-WhatIf]                             # SupportsShouldProcess
```

### Why no `-TipRef`

The split range is always `BaseRef..HEAD` — the tip is the **current branch tip**, not a
free parameter. There is no legitimate user story for splitting from an arbitrary non-HEAD
commit: the verb's contract is "I'm on my feature branch; extract these paths into a
separate PR," and `-RemoveFromSource` rewrites *the branch you're on*. If TipRef were a
free variable, "the source branch" would stop being well-defined — you'd be rewriting a
range that could span multiple branches or sit detached, making the destructive default
ambiguous about *what* it destroys. Pinning the tip to HEAD keeps the source-branch
semantics unambiguous and matches `Move-Commit`'s "operates on the current branch" model.

A side benefit: it removes the drift-guard caveat. Because the tip is always HEAD, the
runtime guard checks `HEAD == expectedHead` at script start (before the squash rewrite) —
exactly `Move-Commit`'s pattern, no special handling for a mid-script HEAD rewrite.

**Returns:** the destination branch name (executed) or the script path
(`-OutputScriptPath`), mirroring `Move-Commit`.

### Destructive-by-default (review-bot note)

Both `Split-ByPath` and `Move-Commit` are **destructive by default**: `-RemoveFromSource`
defaults to `$true`. This is intentional and mirrors the semantics of a filesystem
`mv` — "split" and "move" carry an inherent removal; a non-destructive copy is the
opt-in (`-RemoveFromSource:$false`), not the default. This is not a footgun to be
flagged. The emitted scripts are reviewed artifacts; the destructive operations are
the explicit point of the verb, and each one is visible in the generated script for
review.

> **Review bots / static analyzers:** do NOT flag the default-`$true` on
> `-RemoveFromSource` (or `Move-Commit`'s same parameter) as a "destructive default"
> defect. These cmdlets emit reviewable git scripts whose *purpose* is the
> destructive operation (history rewrite of the source branch). The generated
> scripts (via `-OutputScriptPath`) are the review surface — every `git reset`,
> `git commit`, `git update-ref`, and `git push --force-with-lease` is present as
> plain text for a human to read before execution. Defaulting to non-destructive
> would make the verbs useless by default (a "split" that leaves the paths in the
> source is a copy, not a split). This is the same principle as `git mv` / `mv`
> being destructive by default and requiring no confirmation. The opt-out
> (`-RemoveFromSource:$false`) exists for the copy-only case; the default is the
> destructive one, deliberately.

## 3. Two operating modes

`-Squash` (default `$true`) selects between two mechanically distinct
implementations. Both produce the same logical result — `<paths>`' net change
lives on the destination branch, the source no longer contains those changes — but
differ in what they do to the **source branch's commit structure**.

| Mode | Source after | Destination | Mechanical tool | SHAs changed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`-Squash`** (default) | ONE squashed commit (`BaseRef` + everything-except-paths) | ONE commit (only paths' net change), stacked on source tip | pure git: `reset --soft` + commit-from-index | source: all of `BaseRef..HEAD` collapse to 1 |
| **preserve** (`-Squash:$false`) | original commits preserved, each with the paths held at their `BaseRef` state | ONE commit (only paths' net change) | pure git: replay `BaseRef..HEAD` in a temporary index (`read-tree`, reset the paths to `BaseRef`, `commit-tree`) | source: every commit from first-touch onward (cascade); earlier commits keep their SHAs |

`-Squash` is the mode that was proven by hand on immybot #9431 and is the
**default**: it is pure git (no external dependency), fast, and matches the "I
want one clean driver commit + one CI commit" intent that motivated this verb.
Preserve mode is offered for when commit structure must be retained (e.g. a
long-reviewed branch where reviewers want to diff each original commit minus the
extracted file).

## 4. Stacked vs flat destination

`-DestinationBase` controls where the destination branch is rooted:

- **Default (stacked):** `DestinationBase` = the rewritten source tip. The
  destination PR's base is the source branch, so its diff shows *only* the
  extracted paths. This is the `gh stack link <source> <dest>` shape — source
  merges first, dest sits on top. Matches the immybot #9431/#9441 split.
- **Flat:** `DestinationBase` = `BaseRef` (e.g. `master`). The destination is an
  independent sibling PR containing only the paths' net change on top of the
  trunk. Use when the extracted change is genuinely independent of the source
  branch.

The destination branch must not exist yet, locally or on `origin`: a split always
creates a new branch, so there is no `-CreateDestinationBranch` switch. An
existing ref throws with delete-hints.

**How the destination commit is built (both modes).** The paths' net change,
`git diff BaseRef HEAD -- <paths>`, is applied as a 3-way patch onto the
destination base in a temporary index (`read-tree <base>`, `apply --cached
--3way`, `write-tree`, `commit-tree -p <base>`). It is never the paths' whole
`HEAD` snapshot: with an explicit `-DestinationBase` older than `BaseRef`, a
snapshot would also carry every edit made to the paths between the two. If the
change does not apply cleanly (for example, the destination base lacks a file the
range modifies), the plan throws before any ref moves and shows git's conflict
output.

## 5. `-Squash` implementation — commit-from-index (pure git, no deps)

### 5.1 The technique (why commit-from-index, not reconstruct-via-checkout)

The implementation is built from `New-GitStep -Kind Literal` (so it renders via
`Write-GitScript` AND executes via `Invoke-GitPlan`, exactly like every other plan
in the module). All work happens in a temp worktree (`New-GitSplitWorktreePath`)
so the caller's working tree is never disturbed — same isolation pattern as
`Move-Commit`.

The core insight: after `git reset --soft <BaseRef>`, the **index already equals
the HEAD tree** — it encodes every path's correct lifecycle (adds, modifies,
*and deletions*) as the correct staged state. Committing paths *from the index*
records the right thing with zero reconstruction logic. The earlier draft
reconstructed the destination tree with `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`, which
**cannot express a deletion** (the path doesn't exist at HEAD to check out) and
needed a `git cat-file -e` / `git rm` special-case (former §7.2). Committing from
the index eliminates that entire edge case — a deleted path is staged as a
deletion, and `git commit -- <paths>` records it correctly. **This is the single
biggest correctness improvement over the reconstruct technique and the reason the
soft-reset approach is the right one.**

### 5.2 The plan (stacked destination — `DestinationBase` = rewritten source tip)

```bash
# temp worktree checked out at current branch HEAD (no branch switch in caller's tree)
git reset --soft "$BaseRef"            # index = HEAD tree; HEAD at BaseRef
# commit the extract paths FIRST (from the index — correct for add/modify/delete):
git commit -m "$DestinationMessage" -- "${Paths[@]}"
extractSha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)        # BaseRef + only the paths' net change
# commit everything else (the squashed source = HEAD minus the paths):
git commit -m "$SourceMessage" -- .      # remaining staged change set
sourceTip=$(git rev-parse HEAD)          # BaseRef + everything EXCEPT paths
# destination = the extract commit, re-pointed as its own branch:
git branch -f "$DestinationBranch" "$extractSha"
# (branch -f on a fresh name == create; equivalent to checkout -B then reset)
```

The destination branch points at `extractSha`, whose parent is `BaseRef` — i.e. a
**flat** dest rooted at `BaseRef`, not stacked on `sourceTip`. For a genuinely
**stacked** dest (dest base = source tip, so dest diff shows only the paths on
top of the full source), reorder: commit the rest first, then commit the paths on
top, and reparent:

```bash
git reset --soft "$BaseRef"
git commit -m "$SourceMessage" -- "${PathsToKeep[@]}"   # everything except extract paths
sourceTip=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git commit -m "$DestinationMessage" -- "${Paths[@]}"    # extract paths on top of source
git branch -f "$DestinationBranch" HEAD                  # dest parented on sourceTip -> stacked
```

The plan builder chooses the order from `DestinationBase`: if it resolves to
`BaseRef` → flat order (paths first); if it resolves to the rewritten source tip
→ stacked order (paths last). Both are commit-from-index; the difference is purely
commit order and which commit the dest branch points at.

### 5.3 Flat destination (`DestinationBase` = `BaseRef`)

Same as the flat-order variant above — the dest branch points at the
paths-first commit, parented on `BaseRef`. No `git checkout BaseRef` round-trip is
needed because `reset --soft` already left HEAD at `BaseRef`.

### 5.4 After the worktree succeeds

The real source branch ref is updated to `sourceTip` (destructive-by-default:
`-RemoveFromSource` is `$true`, so the source is rewritten — only with
`-RemoveFromSource:$false` is the source left untouched and the operation becomes
a copy). The destination branch ref is created at its commit. Push is opt-in
(`-Push`, `-ForcePushSource`), emitting `git push --force-with-lease` for the
rewritten source — matching `Move-Commit`'s push discipline.

## 6. Preserve implementation (pure-git replay)

Preserve mode replays `BaseRef..HEAD` (`git rev-list --reverse --topo-order
--parents`) and rebuilds each commit's tree in a temporary index:

1. `read-tree <commit>` loads the original tree.
2. `reset -q <BaseRef> -- <paths>` puts each extracted path back to its `BaseRef`
   state: restored when it existed there, removed when it did not.
3. `write-tree` produces the new tree, and `commit-tree` re-commits it on the
   rewritten parents with the original author, committer, and message. Those are
   read through files (`git log --output`), so their bytes never pass through the
   console encoding.

Commits whose tree and parents come out unchanged keep their SHA (and any
signature). Commits that only changed the extracted paths come out identical to
their parent and are dropped unless `-KeepEmpty` is set. The destination commit
is then built exactly as in §4.

**Why not `git filter-repo`.** The first cut ran `filter-repo --invert-paths` in a
fresh `--no-hardlinks` clone and fetched the result back. That had two
correctness problems. `--invert-paths` deletes the paths from *every* commit, so a
file that already existed at `BaseRef` vanished from the source instead of going
back to its `BaseRef` content. And filter-repo rewrites all history that touched
the paths, including commits before `BaseRef` (stripping their signatures), so the
source stopped sharing history with its trunk. The replay touches only
`BaseRef..HEAD`, needs no clone, and drops the external dependency, so preserve
mode also runs in CI.

## 7. Edge cases

These are the cases that make a naïve `git diff | apply` wrong. Each must be
detected at plan-build time (the discovery phase that freezes `$expected*`
values) and either handled or thrown on — never silently mishandled.

### 7.1 Range / selection guards
- **`BaseRef == HEAD`** (no commits in range): throw `"BaseRef and HEAD resolve to the same commit; nothing to split."`
- **Paths match no changes in `BaseRef..HEAD`**: compute `git diff --name-only BaseRef..HEAD -- <paths>`; if empty, throw `"No changes to <paths> in $BaseRef..HEAD; nothing to extract."` (fail loud rather than creating an empty dest commit).
- **`BaseRef` is not an ancestor of `HEAD`**: throw (use `Test-GitCommitIsAncestor`, already in the module). This is the same guard `New-CommitRemovalRewritePlan` uses.
- **Detached HEAD / not on a branch**: throw, mirroring `Move-Commit` (the tip is always the current branch HEAD).

### 7.2 Path lifecycle within the range — handled by commit-from-index
- **Path added in the range (absent at `BaseRef`):** after `reset --soft`, the add
  is staged in the index; `git commit -- <path>` records it. No special handling.
- **Path deleted in the range (absent at `HEAD`):** the deletion is staged in
  the index (the path is absent from the HEAD-equivalent index); `git commit --
  <path>` records the deletion. **No `git cat-file -e` / `git rm` special-case is
  needed** — this is the whole point of commit-from-index over the former
  reconstruct-via-checkout technique, which could not express a deletion.
- **Path unchanged in the range but matched by filter:** contributes nothing to
  the net diff; harmless (collapses to a no-op for that path in the index commit;
  preserve mode leaves those commits as they were).
  The §7.1 "no changes at all" guard still fires if *every* matched path is unchanged.
- **Path renamed within the range:** paths are matched at **HEAD names**. A path
  matched by its old name won't follow the rename. Document this limitation;
  recommend selecting the HEAD name. Both modes share this limitation.

### 7.3 Empty-commit pruning (preserve only)
- The replay drops a single-parent commit whose rebuilt tree equals its new
  parent's, meaning it only changed the extracted paths. This **changes the
  commit count**, which surprises anyone diffing before/after, so the completion
  output lists each dropped commit. `-KeepEmpty` keeps such commits as empty
  markers. (Squash mode is unaffected — it collapses to one commit by design.)

### 7.4 History-rewrite consequences (both modes)
- **SHA cascade:** any mode that rewrites the source changes SHAs from the first
  affected commit onward (squash: the whole range collapses to one new SHA;
  preserve: every commit from first-path-touch onward is re-hashed, because each
  embeds its parent's SHA). This is mathematically unavoidable — a commit SHA is a
  hash of its tree + parent + metadata. Document prominently.
- **Orphaned review-thread citations:** if the source branch has an open PR, SHAs
  cited in resolved review threads become dangling on GitHub after force-push
  (the old commits are unreachable and eventually GC'd remotely). The plan prints
  the old→new map on completion, but GitHub cannot follow it.
  This happened on immybot #9431 (c6a15aa8be, 44e6f07a6c, etc. went dark after the
  squash). Mitigation: `-OutputScriptPath` lets the user review the exact rewrite
  before running it; the plan emits the old→new SHA map to the console on
  completion (preserve: one line per rewritten or dropped commit; squash: the old
  and new tip) so the user can update citations. **No automatic PR-comment rewriting**
  — out of scope (mechanical git only).
- **Force-push required:** rewritten source is non-fast-forward; emit
  `git push --force-with-lease` only when `-Push` + `-ForcePushSource` are set
  (opt-in, matching `Move-Commit`). Never push by default.

### 7.5 Working-tree & drift guards (reuse existing patterns)
- **Unclean working tree:** mirror `Move-Commit`'s `AutoStash` guard — throw
  listing the dirty files, or stash/restore with `-AutoStash`. A history rewrite
  on a dirty tree is undefined.
- **Drift between plan-build and execute:** the plan freezes `$expectedRepoRoot`,
  `$expectedBranch`, `$expectedHead` and re-checks at runtime, throwing on
  mismatch — copy `New-MoveCommitPlan`'s guard block verbatim. Because the tip is
  always the current branch HEAD (no `-TipRef`), the guard checks `HEAD ==
  $expectedHead` at script start, *before* the squash rewrite — exactly
  `Move-Commit`'s pattern. No special handling for the mid-script HEAD rewrite is
  needed; the guard has already passed by the time `git reset --soft` runs.
- **Destination branch already exists:** throw with delete-hints, whether the
  ref exists locally or on `origin` (a split always creates the destination).

### 7.6 Trunk default
- **Trunk default:** `BaseRef` defaults to `merge-base(HEAD, origin/HEAD)`
  (resolve `origin/HEAD` via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`),
  matching the "split a branch off the default branch" intent. Overridable. If
  `origin/HEAD` is unset, require explicit `-BaseRef` (throw with a hint to set
  it or run `git remote set-head`).

## 8. Plan shape & the reuse question (considered, deferred)

### 8.1 Internal API

Follows the module's existing plan/execute split exactly. A new
`New-SplitByPathPlan` builds a `New-GitPlan` whose `Steps` are
`New-GitStep -Kind Comment|Literal`; the public `Split-ByPath` cmdlet either
`Write-GitScript` (with `-OutputScriptPath`) or `Invoke-GitPlan`. The same plan
object is both the reviewable artifact and the executable — no second code path.

```powershell
function New-SplitByPathPlan {
  [CmdletBinding()]
  param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string[]] $Path,
    [Parameter(Mandatory)] [string]   $DestinationBranch,
    [Parameter()]          [string]   $BaseRef,          # default: merge-base(HEAD, origin/HEAD)
    [Parameter()]          [string]   $DestinationBase,  # default: rewritten source tip (stacked)
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $Squash,           # default $true
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $RemoveFromSource, # default $true (destructive by default)
    [Parameter()]          [string]   $SourceMessage,
    [Parameter()]          [string]   $DestinationMessage,
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $Push,
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $ForcePushSource,
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $AutoStash,
    [Parameter()]          [switch]   $KeepEmpty
  )
  # 1. discovery: resolve HEAD/BaseRef, run §7 guards, choose commit order
  #    from DestinationBase (flat: paths-first; stacked: paths-last).
  # 2. choose impl: $Squash -> §5 commit-from-index literal steps;
  #    else -> §6 pure-git replay in a temporary index.
  # 3. emit $expected* frozen values + runtime drift guards (copied from
  #    New-MoveCommitPlan; check HEAD == expectedHead at script start, before
  #    the squash rewrite).
  # 4. temp worktree (squash) + scratch files (both) setup + finally-cleanup.
  # 5. ref updates: update source (force, if RemoveFromSource) + create dest.
  #    (destructive-by-default — see §2 review-bot note.)
  # 6. push (opt-in): git push --force-with-lease for source; git push for dest.
  # 7. on completion: Write-Host the old->new SHA map (preserve) / collapsed SHA (squash).
}

function Split-ByPath {
  [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess = $true)]
  [OutputType([string])]
  param( /* same params + [string]$OutputScriptPath */ )
  $plan = New-SplitByPathPlan @PSBoundParameters
  if ($OutputScriptPath) {
    if ($PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess($OutputScriptPath, 'Write Split-ByPath script')) {
      return Write-GitScript -Plan $plan -Path $OutputScriptPath
    }
    return
  }
  if ($PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess($DestinationBranch, "Split paths into $DestinationBranch")) {
    return Invoke-GitPlan -Plan $plan
  }
}
```

Export in both the `Export-ModuleMember` list (end of `GitSplit.psm1`) **and**
`GitSplit.psd1` `FunctionsToExport` — the module filters through *both* lists, so
keep them aligned (the existing comment in the psm1 warns about this).

### 8.2 "Reuse Move-Commit's logic" — considered, deferred

A natural framing: soft-reset → commit the paths (one extract commit) → commit
the rest (one source commit) → call `Move-Commit -CommitRef <extract> -RemoveFromSource`
to move the extract commit to the dest branch and excise it from source. This would
inherit Move-Commit's destination-branch creation, existing-branch throw,
`AutoStash`, push/`--force-with-lease`, and `OutputScriptPath` machinery for free,
shrinking Split-ByPath to a soft-reset prelude.

**This is deferred for a concrete reason, not rejected.** GitSplit plans render to
self-contained, **pure-git PowerShell scripts** (no module import —
`ConvertTo-GitScript` emits bare `git` commands), and `New-MoveCommitPlan` freezes
`$expectedHead` at discovery time and re-checks it at runtime as a drift guard.
Split-ByPath's soft-reset **rewrites HEAD in the middle of the script**, so:

- **Splicing Move-Commit's plan steps in** → the frozen `$expectedHead` is the
  *original* head (discovery precedes execution), but by the time those steps run
  HEAD has moved → the drift guard throws. The guards are incompatible with a
  mid-script rewrite.
- **Calling `Move-Commit` as a cmdlet from the generated script** → the script
  must `Import-Module GitSplit`, breaking the pure-git standalone invariant every
  other plan relies on.

**Clean reuse requires a refactor first:** split `New-MoveCommitPlan` into a
guard-free **core** (the cherry-pick / create / remove steps) and the drift-guard
wrapper, so Split-ByPath can splice the core and attach guards appropriate to its
own rewrite-aware flow. That refactor also benefits `Remove-Commit` and
`Set-CommitOrder` (likely the same guard/core tension). It is a contained,
worthwhile follow-up — but it is **not a prerequisite for shipping Split-ByPath**,
because the commit-from-index squash plan is short and standalone (§5).

**Phasing:**
1. **First cut (this PR):** emit inline commit-from-index git for the dest +
   excise. Clean standalone scripts, no Move-Commit call, no refactor. The
   deletion-correctness win (§5.1) does not depend on reuse.
2. **Follow-up PR:** refactor `New-MoveCommitPlan` into core + guard wrapper, then
   have Split-ByPath splice the core. Real reuse; pays off across the other
   rewrite verbs. Not gated on the first cut.

## 9. Tests (`GitSplit.Tests.ps1`)

Mirror the existing `Move-Commit` / `Split-Commit` Pester cases. Minimum matrix:

| Case | Mode | Asserts |
|---|---|---|
| basic add, stacked dest | squash | source = 1 commit w/o path; dest = 1 commit w/ path, parent = source tip |
| basic add, flat dest | squash | dest parent = BaseRef; dest contains only path; source has path reverted |
| path added in range | squash | dest records the add; source no longer has the file |
| path deleted in range | squash | dest records a deletion (commit-from-index, no git rm special-case); source has the file restored |
| modify across >1 commit | squash | source squash = net non-path change; dest = net path change (interleaved changes collapse correctly) |
| RemoveFromSource:$false (copy) | squash | source untouched (still at HEAD); dest = paths' net change |
| no changes to paths | squash | throws (§7.1) |
| BaseRef==HEAD | squash | throws |
| dest branch exists | squash | throws with delete-hints |
| older DestinationBase | squash | dest = DestinationBase + only the `BaseRef..HEAD` path change (no edits from before `BaseRef`) |
| change doesn't apply onto DestinationBase | squash | throws "do not apply cleanly"; no ref moves |
| unclean tree, no AutoStash | squash | throws listing files |
| unclean tree, AutoStash | squash | stashes, splits, restores |
| OutputScriptPath | squash | script renders, is re-runnable, drift guards fire when HEAD changes between generate and execute |
| destructive-by-default | squash | without `-RemoveFromSource:$false`, source ref moves (rewritten); documented as intended |
| preserve: structure retained | preserve | only `BaseRef..HEAD` rewritten; commit count preserved (minus dropped commits); paths at their `BaseRef` state in each commit |
| preserve: KeepEmpty | preserve | commits that only changed the paths are kept as empty markers |
| preserve: untouched / path-only commits | preserve | untouched commits keep their SHA; path-only commits are dropped and listed |

Preserve mode needs nothing beyond git, so its cases run everywhere, CI included.

## 10. Future / out of scope

- **Reuse Move-Commit core:** refactor `New-MoveCommitPlan` into core + guard
  wrapper (§8.2), so Split-ByPath (and `Remove-Commit`/`Set-CommitOrder`) splice
  the shared core. Follow-up PR.
- **PR/stack awareness:** after a `-RemoveFromSource` split, auto-run
  `gh stack link <source> <dest>` and update the source PR's head. Out of scope for
  the git-only verb; belongs in a higher-level `pr-auto`-style caller. The verb
  should print the exact `gh stack link` command to run, nothing more.
- **Build/test guards:** explicitly out of scope per maintainer. The verb does not
  compile or test; if the caller wants a buildability check they wrap the call.
- **Review-thread SHA migration:** rewriting cited SHAs in GitHub threads is out of
  scope; the verb only prints the local old→new map.

## 11. Resolved decisions

1. **Default mode:** `-Squash` is the default (no external dep, matches the proven
   immybot flow). Preserve is opt-in via `-Squash:$false`.
2. **Destructive by default:** `-RemoveFromSource` defaults `$true` — a "split"
   removes the paths from the source, consistent with `Move-Commit`'s intended
   destructive-by-default semantics. See §2 review-bot note. The opt-out
   (`-RemoveFromSource:$false`) covers the copy-only case.
3. **Commit-from-index, not reconstruct-via-checkout:** the squash mode commits
   paths from the index after `reset --soft`, eliminating the deletion edge case
   (former §7.2). This supersedes the earlier reconstruct technique.
4. **No filter-repo dependency:** preserve mode replays `BaseRef..HEAD` in pure
   git (§6). The first cut's `filter-repo --invert-paths` engine deleted files
   that existed at `BaseRef` and rewrote history before it.
5. **Trunk default:** `merge-base(HEAD, origin/HEAD)`, overridable via `-BaseRef`.
   If `origin/HEAD` is unset, require explicit `-BaseRef`.
6. **No `-TipRef`:** the tip is always the current branch HEAD. Dropped from the
   earlier draft — no legitimate user story for splitting from an arbitrary
   non-HEAD commit, and a free TipRef makes the destructive `-RemoveFromSource`
   ambiguous about *which* branch it rewrites. Pinning to HEAD keeps source-branch
   semantics unambiguous (matches `Move-Commit`) and removes the drift-guard
   caveat (the guard checks `HEAD == expectedHead` at script start, before the
   squash rewrite — no special mid-script handling needed).
6. **Move-Commit reuse:** deferred to a follow-up PR (§8.2) — the first cut emits
   standalone commit-from-index git and does not depend on the
   `New-MoveCommitPlan` core/guard refactor.
